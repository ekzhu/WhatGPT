# WhatGPT!

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

WhatGPT! is a full-stack web application that allows users to chat with an AI chatbot using a modern and interactive chat interface. This web app is powered by ChatGPT (GPT-4) and was completely generated by ChatGPT (GPT-4) without any human-written code, except for the "transcript.txt" file, which contains the complete transcript of the ChatGPT session that generated the application. This includes both the source code and this README file.


## Features

- Interactive chat window for engaging with the AI chatbot
- Multiple chat sessions management, allowing users to create new sessions, switch between sessions, and view previous sessions
- Session names are automatically generated based on the content of the chat
- Chat history is stored server-side and repopulated in the frontend upon refreshing the page or switching sessions

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React.js with Bootstrap for styling and Axios for API calls
- Backend: Flask with a simple in-memory storage for chat sessions
- AI Model: ChatGPT (GPT-4) is used to simulate the chatbot's responses
